            <h1>Association between liquor stores and crime rates in New York City.</h1>
            <p>  
                The alcohol-violence link is well-established in social science research, particularly focusing on the geospatial influence
                    of alcohol outlets on violence. Studies(Gorman et al. 2018; Gruenewald and Remer 2006; Livingston 2008; Pridemore and
                    Grubesic 2013; Roman et al. 2008; White, Gainey, and Triplett 2015; Zhu, Gorman, and Horel, 2004) have consistently shown
                    that areas with higher alcohol outlet density tend to have higher rates of violence and street crimes. This relationship
                    has also been observed in relation to interpersonal violence, domestic violence, suicide mortality, and disadvantaged
                    neighborhood characteristics.
                </p>
                Additional research (Gmel, Holmes, and Studer 2016) has explored the spatial influence of different types
                of alcohol outlets on crime, indicating that not all types of outlets are equally criminogenic. These studies have
                primarily compared on-premise (where alcohol is consumed on the premises) and off-premise (where alcohol is sold and
                distributed off the premises) facilities. They have identified that on-premise facilities, such as bars or restaurants,
                have different effects compared to off-premise facilities. While there appears to be a correlation, it's important to
                note that crime rates are influenced by a multitude of factors that may vary by neighborhood. Therefore, this issue
                warrants a deeper exploration to understand the underlying causes of crime in these areas.
                <p>
                <p>New York City is the largest and most diverse metropolis in the United States, comprising multiple communities
                        spread across five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. In the United States,
                        ghettos have historically been associated with racial segregation and discriminatory housing policies such as
                        redlining, which restricted access to mortgage lending and property ownership for people of color. These policies
                        contributed to the creation of urban neighborhoods that were predominantly occupied by low-income African Americans
                        and other minority groups. While the term "ghetto" can be controversial and carries a negative connotation, it is
                        often used in scholarly research and public discourse to refer to areas with high levels of poverty, crime, and 
                        social disadvantage. However, it's important to recognize the complexity of these neighborhoods and the various factors
                        that contribute to their formation and persistence.           
                        <p>
            <p>From 2006, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) reports of violent offences as well as basic information about them.
                    For the current investigation, there will be used the reported crimes after 2013 since they provide the most current
                    and relevant information. On the dataset each record represents one reported arrest in NYC and contains details on the
                    type of crime, the location, and the time of enforcement. Additionally, details about suspect demographics are also
                    presented (age,sex,race).The dataset will be used to examine whether there is a correlation between crime rates in these
                    areas and the number of liquor stores present a new dataset including information about the exact location of the operating
                    liquor stores in NYC will be combined with NYPD dataset. </p> 
                <p> Investigating the correlation between crime rates or types and the location of liquor stores in NYC can help us understand the
                        factors that contribute to crime in specific neighborhoods, identify potential areas for crime prevention efforts, and inform
                        strategies to promote public safety and improve quality of life. By examining the relationship between liquor store density and
                        crime rates, policy decisions and interventions can be made to reduce crime and violence and create safer, more livable communities.

                <p> Zoom as a genre of data story that focuses on a particular subset of the data and allows readers to explore it in more detail was used in
                        this case . The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of a specific aspect of the data by interacting with it directly. Interactive
                        visualizations such as maps and scatter plots and heat maps will help in the exploration of our main goal : correlation between crimes
                        and liquor stores operating in "ghettos" without excluding all the other aereas included in the dataset .  <p>
                <p> In order to visualize spatial data and show the distribution of values across the geographic area a choropleth map (Annotations & Layering) 
                        was created.This type of map uses color to represent different values in different geographic areas the values of our map represent the
                        number of reported crimes divided by the population of each police department district. Using this map it is easy to regognise the areas
                         that are reported as more dangerous in terms of criminal activity but also the exact location of them. On the map the red dots represent
                        the liquor stores operating in different neighbohoods of NYC . It is noted that the dataset used for the liquore stores location was divided
                        into clusters based on the coordinates and distance between each record. Text labels and captions are also tools that fall under Annotations
                        & Layering. Are used to add context and information to a visualization, such as titles, axis labels, and annotations about specific data points
                        or trends in order to make it more clear for the readers. Lastly, readers can zoom in and out on the map created to see more details about a
                        specific region or neighborhood ,preferly "ghettos", or pan across the scatter plot to explore different trends and patterns in the data of the
                        stores. Zoom and pan are particularly useful for exploring the  large and complex dataset  where different levels of detail are important to
                        understanding the overall story . <p>

            Figure 1: Interactive plot for the most common crimes in New York City.
                From the above barplot it is obvious that the drug related crimes
                are the most common followed by assault and offenses. Additionally,
                crime categories like robbery, weapon laws and felony assault are quite common as well.
                
            <p align="center"> Continuing with the analysis the race and the sex of the crime records are
                    explored in order to set a profile of the person that commits the crime. In comparison with the 
                population of the specific gender or race charateristics we could conclude whether they are correlated.

            <p> The bar chart depicts the number of reported incidents for the crime categories with over 10,000 cases in the two districts 
                having the highest crime rates. In the Southern district, larceny/theft stands out as the most frequently occurring crime 
                category with over 80,000 incidents reported, followed by non-criminal and other offenses. On the other hand, in Tenderloin district,
                the numbers are more uniformly distributed, and the most commonly committed crime is drug-related offenses. In general, it is quite obvious the 
                fact that the most common are drug dealing and violent crimes such as assault and theft. Also there is a worth mentioning portion of more light crimes,
                which are reported as non-criminal.

            "Boyz n the Hood" is a 1991 American coming-of-age drama film directed by John Singleton.
            The film tells the story of three young men growing up in South Central Los Angeles, a 
            predominantly black and low-income area known for its high crime rates and gang activity.
            At numerous sequences throughout the film, the problem of the government's failure to take action to reduce 
            crime in particular communities is discussed. In contrast, it is made plain  that the government tend to place
            liquor stores in such neighborhoods which aggravates the situation even more. In this approach, the ghetto
            regions see such a severe decline in value that housing costs are rapidly dropping.. Afterwards these low-price
            houses are sold to landlords 
            who afterwards upgrade them and sell them profitable in the future. This scheme has as higher motive the profit
            of specific individuals at the expense of the safety of the people living in the ghettos.  </p>

        After the aforementioned findings and being motivated by the video, we started looking into the relationship between
        alcohol use and the growth of crime in these two places. Retail shops known as liquor stores are dedicated to the sale
        of alcoholic drinks such beer, wine, and spirits. These shops might also sell food, mixers, and other things that go 
        well with alcoholic beverages. Several jurisdictions have stringent laws governing the location, business hours, and 
        who is permitted to buy alcohol at liquor stores. In certain places, liquor stores are run and owned by the government,
        whereas in other places, they are run and owned by private businesses. Indeed, high levels of alcohol outlet density can
        contribute to various negative outcomes, including increased alcohol consumption, impaired driving, and violent crime.
        Pamela J.Trankenstein et al. in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30256427/">survey</a> have proven that a 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated with
        a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure.  Off-premise outlets such as these liquor stores were found to have a greater
        association with violent crime than on-premise outlets such as bars or pubs.  <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/4099653/do-liquor-stores-increase-crime-and-urban-decay-evidence-from-">Other results</a> show that opening a new alcohol 
        outlet increases both violent and property crimes, especially in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods. Also both surveys conclude that 
        violent and property crimes as well as drug offenses are mostly reported in such regions with a high density of liquor stores. This claim is 
        also confirmed by the above figure of "Crime counts by category and Police District".

        Figure 4: Google maps screenshot for the locations of all liquor stores in San Fransisco
         </p>
      <p>In our case it is clear from a quick search using Maps that the density of liquor stores in those two areas is higher than everywhere else 
          in San Francisco. The stores are not far apart from one another and compared to similar stores in other regions, which are open fewer hours
          a day, their opening hours are longer. This fact facilitates the access of citizens to alcohol and its consumption and makes them more prone
          to criminal activity. Since, drug offenses, violent crimes, and property crimes are all linked to high alcohol use. In conclusion, government's policies
          should be aimed at reducing the density of liquor stores in certain areas. This might be effective in reducing rates of crime and improving the neighborhood's
          residents life quality overall.
