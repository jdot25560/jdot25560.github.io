        <h1>Association between liquor stores and crime rates in San Francisco.</h1>
        <p>  
            The "Police Department Incident Reports Historical 2003 to May 2018.csv" file offers comprehensive information about
            criminal incidents that happened in San Francisco between January 1, 2003, and May 15, 2018.The San Francisco Police
            Department (SFPD) collected, analyzed, and made the information publicly accessible through the San Francisco Open 
            Data Portal. The dataset contains details on the incident's date, time, and place as well as a basic description of the
            incident type (such as theft or larceny, assault, burglary, etc.).It also contains additional precise information about
            each occurrence, such as the crime's description, if an arrest was made. The size of the dataset is quite large, with
            over 1.5 million rows and 35 columns. </p>
        <p> The kind of crimes that are reported in each area  are what define the profile and standard of living of that region. 
            The Bookeh plot is made in order to have an overview of the San Francisco district profiles. So moving on to the chart,
            the percentage rate of each crime category for each district served
            by a police department is shown. Trespassing reports are common in all districts, although the other types of crime differ.
            Drugs, theft, assault, and prostitution are recorded crimes in San Francisco's neighborhoods closest to the city center, whereas
            districts outside the core have high rates of reported crimes involving vehicle theft and reckless driving. The areas in the 
            center are at a high risk due to the types of events that have been observed over the past ten years, but a heated map may make
            this more obvious. </p>

        Figure 1: Bokeh plot for different crime types in the various PdDistricts
        <p align="center">The heated map details the criminal activity that occurred in San Francisco between 2007 and 2017.
            Each district's population and reported offenses were pooled to produce the findings. The area with
            the highest crime rate appears to be the southern district. The highest crime rates are seen in 
            Tenderloin and Southern police departments, even though they have the smallest geographic coverage
            of any of them. The borders of each police agency are established by their workload; therefore, one
            follows directly from the other. Something important to notice is that despite being a component of
            the southern district's police department, Treasure Island had relatively few crimes reported in relation to its population. </p>

        Figure 2: Heatmap which indicates the crime/population for each Police Department District </p>
        <p> The bar chart depicts the number of reported incidents for the crime categories with over 10,000 cases in the two districts 
            having the highest crime rates. In the Southern district, larceny/theft stands out as the most frequently occurring crime 
            category with over 80,000 incidents reported, followed by non-criminal and other offenses. On the other hand, in Tenderloin district,
            the numbers are more uniformly distributed, and the most commonly committed crime is drug-related offenses. In general, it is quite obvious the 
            fact that the most common are drug dealing and violent crimes such as assault and theft. Also there is a worth mentioning portion of more light crimes,
            which are reported as non-criminal.

    <p>"Boyz n the Hood" is a 1991 American coming-of-age drama film directed by John Singleton.
        The film tells the story of three young men growing up in South Central Los Angeles, a 
        predominantly black and low-income area known for its high crime rates and gang activity.
        At numerous sequences throughout the film, the problem of the government's failure to take action to reduce 
        crime in particular communities is discussed. In contrast, it is made plain  that the government tend to place
        liquor stores in such neighborhoods which aggravates the situation even more. In this approach, the ghetto
        regions see such a severe decline in value that housing costs are rapidly dropping.. Afterwards these low-price
        houses are sold to landlords 
        who afterwards upgrade them and sell them profitable in the future. This scheme has as higher motive the profit
        of specific individuals at the expense of the safety of the people living in the ghettos.  </p>

    After the aforementioned findings and being motivated by the video, we started looking into the relationship between
    alcohol use and the growth of crime in these two places. Retail shops known as liquor stores are dedicated to the sale
    of alcoholic drinks such beer, wine, and spirits. These shops might also sell food, mixers, and other things that go 
    well with alcoholic beverages. Several jurisdictions have stringent laws governing the location, business hours, and 
    who is permitted to buy alcohol at liquor stores. In certain places, liquor stores are run and owned by the government,
    whereas in other places, they are run and owned by private businesses. Indeed, high levels of alcohol outlet density can
    contribute to various negative outcomes, including increased alcohol consumption, impaired driving, and violent crime.
    Pamela J.Trankenstein et al. in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30256427/">survey</a> have proven that a 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated with
    a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure.  Off-premise outlets such as these liquor stores were found to have a greater
    association with violent crime than on-premise outlets such as bars or pubs.  <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/4099653/do-liquor-stores-increase-crime-and-urban-decay-evidence-from-">Other results</a> show that opening a new alcohol 
    outlet increases both violent and property crimes, especially in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods. Also both surveys conclude that 
    violent and property crimes as well as drug offenses are mostly reported in such regions with a high density of liquor stores. This claim is 
    also confirmed by the above figure of "Crime counts by category and Police District".

     </p>
  <p>In our case it is clear from a quick search using Maps that the density of liquor stores in those two areas is higher than everywhere else 
      in San Francisco. The stores are not far apart from one another and compared to similar stores in other regions, which are open fewer hours
      a day, their opening hours are longer. This fact facilitates the access of citizens to alcohol and its consumption and makes them more prone
      to criminal activity. Since, drug offenses, violent crimes, and property crimes are all linked to high alcohol use. In conclusion, government's policies
      should be aimed at reducing the density of liquor stores in certain areas. This might be effective in reducing rates of crime and improving the neighborhood's
      residents life quality overall.
