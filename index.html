        <p> Data Introduction 
            The "Police Department Incident Reports Historical 2003 to May 2018.csv" file offers comprehensive information about
            criminal incidents that happened in San Francisco between January 1, 2003, and May 15, 2018.The San Francisco Police
            Department (SFPD) collected, analyzed, and made the information publicly accessible through the San Francisco Open 
            Data Portal. The dataset contains details on the incident's date, time, and place as well as a basic description of the
            incident type (such as theft or larceny, assault, burglary, etc.).It also contains additional precise information about
            each occurrence, such as the crime's description, if an arrest was made, and the victim's and suspect's racial and ethnic
            backgrounds. The size of the dataset is quite large, with over 1.5 million rows and 35 columns.   </p>
