            <h1>Association between liquor stores and crime rates in New York City.</h1>
            <p>  
                The alcohol-violence link is well-established in social science research, particularly focusing on the geospatial influence
                    of alcohol outlets on violence. Studies(Gorman et al. 2018; Gruenewald and Remer 2006; Livingston 2008; Pridemore and
                    Grubesic 2013; Roman et al. 2008; White, Gainey, and Triplett 2015; Zhu, Gorman, and Horel, 2004) have consistently shown
                    that areas with higher alcohol outlet density tend to have higher rates of violence and street crimes. This relationship
                    has also been observed in relation to interpersonal violence, domestic violence, suicide mortality, and disadvantaged
                    neighborhood characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>
                Additional research (Gmel, Holmes, and Studer 2016) has explored the spatial influence of different types
                of alcohol outlets on crime, indicating that not all types of outlets are equally criminogenic. These studies have
                primarily compared on-premise (where alcohol is consumed on the premises) and off-premise (where alcohol is sold and
                distributed off the premises) facilities. They have identified that on-premise facilities, such as bars or restaurants,
                have different effects compared to off-premise facilities. While there appears to be a correlation, it's important to
                note that crime rates are influenced by a multitude of factors that may vary by neighborhood. Therefore, this issue
                warrants a deeper exploration to understand the underlying causes of crime in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>New York City is the largest and most diverse metropolis in the United States, comprising multiple communities
                        spread across five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island. In the United States,
                        ghettos have historically been associated with racial segregation and discriminatory housing policies such as
                        redlining, which restricted access to mortgage lending and property ownership for people of color. These policies
                        contributed to the creation of urban neighborhoods that were predominantly occupied by low-income African Americans
                        and other minority groups. While the term "ghetto" can be controversial and carries a negative connotation, it is
                        often used in scholarly research and public discourse to refer to areas with high levels of poverty, crime, and 
                        social disadvantage. However, it's important to recognize the complexity of these neighborhoods and the various factors
                        that contribute to their formation and persistence.           
                        </p>
            <p>From 2006, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) reports of violent offences as well as basic information about them.
                    For the current investigation, there will be used the reported crimes after 2013 since they provide the most current
                    and relevant information. On the dataset each record represents one reported arrest in NYC and contains details on the
                    type of crime, the location, and the time of enforcement. Additionally, details about suspect demographics are also
                    presented (age,sex,race).The dataset will be used to examine whether there is a correlation between crime rates in these
                    areas and the number of liquor stores present a new dataset including information about the exact location of the operating
                    liquor stores in NYC will be combined with NYPD dataset. </p> 
                <p> Investigating the correlation between crime rates or types and the location of liquor stores in NYC can help us understand the
                        factors that contribute to crime in specific neighborhoods, identify potential areas for crime prevention efforts, and inform
                        strategies to promote public safety and improve quality of life. By examining the relationship between liquor store density and
                        crime rates, policy decisions and interventions can be made to reduce crime and violence and create safer, more livable communities.
                        </p>
                <p> Zoom as a genre of data story that focuses on a particular subset of the data and allows readers to explore it in more detail was used in
                        this case . The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of a specific aspect of the data by interacting with it directly. Interactive
                        visualizations such as maps and scatter plots and heat maps will help in the exploration of our main goal : correlation between crimes
                        and liquor stores operating in "ghettos" without excluding all the other aereas included in the dataset .  </p>
                <p> In order to visualize spatial data and show the distribution of values across the geographic area a choropleth map (Annotations & Layering) 
                        was created.This type of map uses color to represent different values in different geographic areas the values of our map represent the
                        number of reported crimes divided by the population of each police department district. Using this map it is easy to regognise the areas
                         that are reported as more dangerous in terms of criminal activity but also the exact location of them. On the map the red dots represent
                        the liquor stores operating in different neighbohoods of NYC . It is noted that the dataset used for the liquore stores location was divided
                        into clusters based on the coordinates and distance between each record. Text labels and captions are also tools that fall under Annotations
                        & Layering. Are used to add context and information to a visualization, such as titles, axis labels, and annotations about specific data points
                        or trends in order to make it more clear for the readers. Lastly, readers can zoom in and out on the map created to see more details about a
                        specific region or neighborhood ,preferly "ghettos", or pan across the scatter plot to explore different trends and patterns in the data of the
                        stores. Zoom and pan are particularly useful for exploring the  large and complex dataset  where different levels of detail are important to
                        understanding the overall story . </p>

            Figure 1: Interactive plot for the most common crimes in New York City.
                From the above barplot it is obvious that the drug related crimes
                are the most common followed by assault and offenses. Additionally,
                crime categories like robbery, weapon laws and felony assault are quite common as well.                
            <p align="center"> Continuing with the analysis the race and the sex of the crime records are
                    explored in order to set a profile of the person that commits the crime. In comparison with the 
                population of the specific gender or race charateristics we could conclude whether they are correlated.

            Figure 2: Bar plot for the population per race for the New York City </p>
                
            <p> As we can see the crimes reported by the african american community are almost double the number of these reported by white people.
                    
                    This is not the case for the population though since according to figure 2 the white population is more than the black one by 1.5 million.
                    To explain these numbers, many factors need to be taken into account, such as socio-economic factors. For this reason, it is common for hasty
                    and incorrect conclusions to be drawn, which can lead to discrimination against racial groups. An example is police discrimination against people
                    of color.
                    <p>Police brutality towards the Black community refers to instances where law enforcement officers use excessive force, discriminatory practices, or display biased behavior specifically targeting individuals who are Black or of African descent. It is a deeply concerning issue that has gained significant attention and sparked widespread protests and discussions in recent years.</p>
    <p>The history of police brutality against Black individuals in the United States is rooted in systemic racism and a legacy of racial discrimination. Throughout history, Black communities have faced disproportionate levels of violence and aggression from law enforcement agencies. This includes incidents of racial profiling, unjustified use of force, racial bias in arrests and sentencing, and even fatal encounters.</p>
    <p>There are several factors that contribute to the issue of police brutality towards the Black community:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Racial bias and stereotypes:
            <p>Implicit biases and preconceived notions about Black individuals can lead to discriminatory treatment by some police officers. These biases may influence perceptions of threat or criminality, resulting in excessive force or unjust treatment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Over-policing and profiling:
            <p>Certain neighborhoods with predominantly Black populations are often subjected to heightened police presence and surveillance. This can lead to increased interactions between law enforcement and community members, increasing the likelihood of confrontations and incidents of police brutality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Lack of accountability:
            <p>There have been cases where law enforcement officers involved in incidents of police brutality, particularly against Black individuals, have not faced adequate consequences for their actions. This lack of accountability can contribute to a culture of impunity and perpetuate a cycle of violence.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Socioeconomic factors:
            <p>The intersection of socioeconomic disparities and policing can contribute to heightened tensions and interactions with law enforcement. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality education, and limited economic opportunities can exacerbate the relationship between police and the communities they serve.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Historical context:
            <p>The long history of systemic racism, including slavery, segregation, and discriminatory practices, has created a legacy of distrust between law enforcement and Black communities. This historical context can shape perceptions and interactions, affecting the dynamics between police officers and individuals of African descent.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to note that not all police officers engage in or support acts of brutality. Many officers work diligently to serve and protect their communities. However, the issue of police brutality highlights the urgent need for systemic reforms, including enhanced training on de-escalation techniques, stricter accountability measures, community policing initiatives, and efforts to address underlying racial biases within law enforcement agencies.</p>
    <p>Addressing police brutality requires a multifaceted approach that involves community engagement, legislative reforms, and changes in policing practices. It is crucial to promote transparency, accountability, and equity within the criminal justice system to ensure thethe fair and just treatment of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

        After the aforementioned findings we started looking into the relationship between
        alcohol use and the growth of crime in the different precincts of the NY city. Retail shops known as liquor stores are dedicated to the sale
        of alcoholic drinks such beer, wine, and spirits. These shops might also sell food, mixers, and other things complement 
         with alcoholic beverages. Several jurisdictions have stringent laws governing the location, business hours, and 
        who is permitted to buy alcohol at liquor stores. In certain places, liquor stores are run and owned by the government,
        whereas in other places, they are run and owned by private businesses. Indeed, high levels of alcohol outlet density can
        contribute to various negative outcomes, including increased alcohol consumption, impaired driving, and violent crime.
        Pamela J.Trankenstein et al. in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30256427/">survey</a> have proven that a 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated with
        a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure.  Off-premise outlets such as these liquor stores were found to have a greater
        association with violent crime than on-premise outlets such as bars or pubs.  <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/4099653/do-liquor-stores-increase-crime-and-urban-decay-evidence-from-">Other results</a> show that opening a new alcohol 
        outlet increases both violent and property crimes, especially in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods. Also both surveys conclude that 
        violent and property crimes as well as drug offenses are mostly reported in such regions with a high density of liquor stores. Below there is displayed
        a map of the crimes reported for each precinct. Also there will be plotted on the map the positions of liquor stores across NY.
        </p>

                <p>
                Figure 4: Choropleth map for the density of the crimes per percinct and the location of the liquir stores. At a first glance, the areas with high
                criminality (yellow and green areas) seem to exhibit  a higher prevelance of red dots (liquor stores) than the blue areas. This is not absolute though
                since we can spot areas with yellow color that there are no clusters of liquor stores. The same applies for some of the blue areas like precinct 112 
                (center of the map) which has some clusters included. The clustering of the liquor stores was done in order to make the results more vivid. 
                 
            </p> 
             <img src="https://jdot25560.github.io/cross_plot.png" alt="crime_counts" style="height: 300px; width:700px;"/>
            <p>
            Figure 5: Cross plot of the percentages of the liquor stores and the crimes for 20 precincts.</p>
            <p> On the above plot by comparing the columns for each precinct we can get an idea on whether the liquor stores and the crime counts have any relationship between them.
                    By observing the figure it can be concluded that the two bars for each precinct tend to be close with the other. Which means that the same percentage of crimes is occuring
                    as the percentage of the liquor stores in each area. This is again, not absolute since there are areas that do not have the same pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The relationship between alcohol outlets and criminality in ghettos is complex. While there is no direct causal link, certain factors contribute to the association. Concentration of disadvantages, accessibility of alcohol, social disorganization, violence and disorder, and targeting vulnerable populations are key factors. The presence of alcohol outlets in ghettos can contribute to increased alcohol consumption and availability, potentially leading to higher rates of criminal behavior. However, it is important to consider contextual factors and individual characteristics. Addressing these issues requires community development, economic revitalization, improved education, access to social services, and targeted interventions for substance abuse. Implementing regulations on alcohol outlet density and location, along with responsible sales practices, can help mitigate negative impacts.
