        <h1>Social data analysis and visualization, Assignment 2</h1>
        <p> The paper examines whether the presence of liquor stores causes crime and urban decay, 
            or if liquor stores tend to open in declining neighborhoods. The study uses data on
            alcohol outlet locations, crime reports, and property transactions in Los Angeles to
            evaluate the effects of outlet openings and closings on crime rates and property values.
            The results show that opening a new alcohol outlet increases both violent and property crimes,
            especially in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods. Outlet closings have smaller impacts,
            but closing an outlet in a low-SES neighborhood reduces crime. Homeowners in high-SES neighborhoods
            value alcohol outlets, while those in low-SES neighborhoods view them as a negative factor. 
            Overall, the study suggests that additional alcohol outlets, especially in low-SES neighborhoods,
            contribute to crime and urban decay.

            Do Liquor Stores Increase Crime and Urban Decay? Evidence from Los Angeles. 
This study investigated the relationship between alcohol outlet access and violent crime in Baltimore, Maryland.
            Using routine activity theory and spatial access methods, the study analyzed data on alcohol outlets, violent crimes,
            and markers of social disorganization. The results showed that a 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated
            with a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure. Off-premise outlets and combined on- and off-premise outlets were found
            to have a greater association with violent crime than on-premise outlets. The study suggests that the lack of effective
            measures to maintain order around off-premise outlets could contribute to increased violent crime in these areas
